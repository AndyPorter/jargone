##Installation

Follow the two step [installation instructions](http://rooreynolds.github.com/jargone/)

##Adding to the Jargon List

Once some words have been added to the `jargonfile.txt`, the `jargone.js` will need to be rebuilt to include the
new wordlist. That is as simple as opening a Terminal and from the project directory running:

    ./build.sh

The resulting new `jargone.js` can then be committed to GitHub.
